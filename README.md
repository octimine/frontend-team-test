# Instructions

1. Using Laravel 5.3 build a simple API to support a CRUD operation;
2. Using your Javascript framework of choice, build a simple but working application to consume the data provided by the API;
3. Provide clear instructions on how to download and run the application.

You can use any CSS framework to make it more appealing. If your Javascript framework provides a command line interface to bootstrap the initial project it should be used. Use the most up-to-date toolset available.

If you have any question feel free to send an email to **Fabio Vedovelli** on *vedovelli@octimine.com*.

**Good luck**.
